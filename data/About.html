             <p>Journey through Europe is a family board game published by Ravensburger. </p>
			 <p>The board is a map of Europe with various major cities marked, for example, Athens, Amsterdam and London. </p>
			<p>The players are given a home city from which they will begin and are then dealt a number of cards with various other cities on them. </p>
			<p>They must plan a route between each of the cities in their hand of cards. On each turn they throw a die and move between the cities. </p>
			<p>The winner is the first player to visit each of their cities and then return to their home base.</p>
